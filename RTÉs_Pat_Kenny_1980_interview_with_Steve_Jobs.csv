0:00,in Cork former employees of Apple were
0:02,today fondly remembering the visits
0:04,there of Steve Jobs during the 1980s the
0:07,company's arrival in Cork in 1980 was
0:10,one of Ireland's earliest IT industry
0:12,inward investment stories do you
0:15,actually believe that every home is
0:17,within the short term the next few years
0:18,going to have its own personal computer
0:21,well we base our uh our theory on the
0:23,fact that we make personal computers
0:24,that can be used irrespective of
0:26,location and the home just happens to be
0:28,one of the locations that the computer
0:30,are used in so we foresee apples being
0:32,used in homes but we also foresee them
0:34,being used in businesses and education
0:36,and there's an Apple going up on the
0:37,first space shuttle as you may know to
0:39,control a Biology experiment and of
0:41,course Apple lasted longer than the
0:43,space shuttle Steve Jobs and apple seen
0:45,here arriving in Cork when the company
0:46,was on the verge of winning the race to
0:48,bring out the first personal computer
0:50,Dan burn started with a company in 1981
0:53,he met Mr jobs a number of times over
0:55,the following 13 years he was uh clearly
0:59,uh a genius and I think we'll go down in
1:01,the analy of history of one of the great
1:03,inventors and the great innovators um he
1:06,was a tough guy uh he was tough to work
1:08,for he was tough to work with he was
1:10,very demanding um but clearly a genius
1:13,at the massive Apple facility in Cork
1:15,City the American flag was flying at
1:16,half mast as a sign of respect for Mr
1:19,"jobs many of the 2,000 plus Apple"
1:22,employees here in Cork are engaged in
1:24,high-end strategic work developing and
1:26,bringing to life the vision Steve Jobs
1:28,had when he spoke about her world after
1:31,personal computers with cloud computing
1:33,and other exciting developments the
1:35,Steve Jobs Legacy will be felt for many
1:38,years to come you think he'll be missed
1:40,I have no doubt I mean not alone will
1:42,Apple miss him but the world in general
1:44,will miss him we'll all miss him Daman
