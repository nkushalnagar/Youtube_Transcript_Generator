## Ethical Considerations

Since all the data collected is public, there are not many access violations. However, data collected from this program should be carefully used as although these transcripts are available to the public, the Youtube Channel still has rights over their content. Therefore, a recommendation is to use this for private use or consult Youtube Channel Owners before distributing to public.
