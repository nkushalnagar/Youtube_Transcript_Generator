0:01,today's computer problem at Cape canaval
0:03,was distressing perhaps but for most
0:05,Americans not totally surprising as a
0:08,society we've become used to computer
0:10,problems of one kind or another just as
0:12,we' become used to computers we're so
0:14,used to them in fact that few of us stop
0:16,to think of the extent to which they now
0:18,play a role in our everyday lives a role
0:21,that shows every sign of growing even
0:22,bigger we have two reports the first
0:25,from batina
0:26,Gregory you can't do the simplest things
0:29,today without a computer you can't cash
0:31,a personal check you can't even make a
0:33,phone call without linking into the
0:35,telephone company's computer and if you
0:37,go to the supermarket the chances are
0:39,good a computer will check out your
0:40,groceries mechanically assisted by a
0:43,human being in some areas computers have
0:46,replaced humankind in Washington the
0:49,subway system is run by computer true
0:51,motormen ride in the cabs but only as a
0:53,backup to this computerized service in
0:56,the airline industry computers will
0:58,reserve your seat on a plane and and
1:00,make no mistake when you take off it's
1:02,the computers who tell air traffic
1:03,controllers how to get you safely to
1:05,your destination computers have
1:07,revolutionize the personal credit card
1:09,industry credit card billing would be a
1:12,lot harder to do without the computer
1:14,and of course the computer provides the
1:16,inevitable excuse for mistakes in your
1:18,bills humans often feel like Don keot
1:21,tilting at windmills when it comes to
1:22,fighting the almighty computer miracles
1:25,of modern medical diagnosis are made
1:27,possible by computers and academic
1:30,research is more comprehensive computers
1:32,have had an enormous impact on
1:34,television journalism ABC News
1:36,researchers have millions of hours of
1:38,film and videotape right at their
1:40,fingertips film with an elephant there
1:42,are 223 entries in the ABC News Library
1:46,an elephant at a circus we have 20 such
1:49,entries but if you want an elephant with
1:51,a rider the computer says we have only
1:54,one such film it's a small computer that
1:57,puts the letters on your television
1:58,screen and another one that creat
2:00,special effects which were once too
2:02,expensive and time consuming to produce
2:04,before the age of the computer since
2:07,Wall Street started using computers
2:08,volume on the big board doubled and
2:10,redoubled to as much as 70 million
2:12,shares a day the government certainly
2:14,uses computers when you pay your taxes
2:16,IRS computers will audit the returns the
2:19,federal government also uses computers
2:21,to track down runaway husbands on
2:22,welfare and now the Reagan
2:24,Administration wants to cut down the
2:26,number of welfare Cheats by putting a
2:28,computer cross check on everyone who
2:30,gets government help that's going too
2:32,far says the American civil liberties
2:34,Union but for the most part computers
2:36,have become such a way of life that many
2:38,people believe they don't invade their
2:40,privacy that's because in America today
2:43,life liberty and the pursuit of
2:45,happiness is inevitably linked to a
2:47,computer matina Gregory ABC News New
2:51,York this is Ken kashiwahara personal
2:54,computers are being welcomed in schools
2:56,and in businesses and in homes without
2:59,any mention of invasion of privacy in
3:02,fact assembly lines are literally
3:03,grinding them out attempting to keep up
3:06,with demand personal computers have
3:08,become popular because of their size and
3:10,their cost they are compact because
3:12,their tiny memory banks are made out of
3:14,even tinier microchips a basic unit can
3:17,be had for as little as
3:19,"$1,500 schools use the computers not"
3:21,only to teach children but to teach them
3:23,about computers Educators at this junior
3:26,high school say students are going out
3:28,into a computer world and should know
3:30,something about it small businesses have
3:32,latched on to the personal computer boom
3:34,using the devices to map out Financial
3:36,plans and to print memos and letters all
3:39,at the touch of a
3:42,button and the personal computer is
3:44,beginning to invade the home in this
3:47,house the solar power is controlled and
3:49,regulated by a computer here the
3:51,computer is used to entertain video
3:54,games are programmed and the battle is
3:56,waged and Fred Wilkinson says he uses
3:59,his home home computer to store
4:00,information and to learn it's a daily
4:03,event there isn't a day that goes by
4:05,that either through a magazine or
4:06,through the keyboard or through a
4:08,program or through talking to somebody
4:10,that I don't pick up more and more
4:12,information and it's a Growing
4:14,Experience I know I see that in myself
4:16,and I see it in other people who I deal
4:18,with that started out much the same way
4:20,I have the personal computer boom has
4:23,been a boom to one company in particular
4:25,it has become the Big Apple in this land
4:27,of high technology since the Apple
4:29,computer company was founded 5 years ago
4:31,its sales have skyrocketed from about
4:33,"$100,000 to more than 100 million Steven"
4:36,Jobs helped build the first Apple
4:38,computer in his garage he is now 26
4:41,years old and is chairman of the board
4:43,and he sees his computer's future as the
4:45,future of mankind this is a 21st century
4:48,bicycle that amplifies a certain
4:51,intellectual ability that man has and I
4:54,think that the uh after this process has
4:59,come to maturity the effects that it's
5:01,going to have on society are actually
5:03,going to far outstrip even those that
5:05,the prochemical revolution has
5:08,had but these computers are not
5:10,necessarily simply innocent play things
5:12,of the future some people feel
5:14,threatened by them some think they tend
5:16,to dehumanize and others fear they may
5:20,eventually take over their
5:28,jobs
5:30,ah but at least it still hasn't learned
5:32,how to say back to you Ted back to you
5:37,Ted I'll have my computer talk to you in
5:39,the moment and in a moment we'll talk
5:42,live with the chairman of the Apple
5:43,computer company and with a writer who
5:45,warns of the dangers that computers pose
5:48,to
5:49,society an example of sort of the role
5:51,that computers are now playing in our
5:53,lives in a sense that that computer that
5:54,malfunctioned was really as critical to
5:57,the success of the shuttle as the thrust
5:58,of the boosters that were going to lift
5:59,it up in the air and in essence both the
6:01,boosters and the computer were really
6:03,performing the same type of function
6:05,both were amplifying an inherent ability
6:07,that humans have in other words no more
6:11,could even a small collection of people
6:12,run the shuttle than they could jump up
6:14,in the air several thousand feet in the
6:15,atmosphere all right there is a sense
6:18,though that many of us have who who
6:19,really don't understand how computers
6:21,work or what they do for us or to us uh
6:24,that we are becoming controlled by the
6:27,computers any danger of that happening
6:29,well as you know the product we
6:31,manufacture many people see it for the
6:33,first time and they don't think it's a
6:34,computer it's about 12 lbs you can throw
6:36,it out the window if the relationship
6:37,isn't going so well and I think if you
6:39,look at sort of the process of the
6:41,technological Revolution that we're all
6:43,in it's a process of taking very
6:45,centralized things and making them very
6:47,Democratic if you will very
6:48,individualized making them affordable by
6:51,by individuals for a small collection of
6:53,tasks if you will sort of from the
6:55,passenger train to the Volkswagen all
6:57,right we heard you talking on tape a
6:58,moment ago about the bicycle of the 21st
7:01,century what were you talking about well
7:03,actually I read a survey in Scientific
7:05,American in the early '70s and what this
7:07,survey had done was it measured the
7:09,efficiency of locomotion for various
7:11,species of things on the planet Birds
7:13,fish dogs and it ranked them and uh it
7:16,turned out that the Condor won the
7:18,Condor took the least amount of energy
7:20,to get from point A to point B and man
7:22,sort of came in with a rather
7:23,unimpressive showing about a third of
7:25,the way down the list but someone at uh
7:27,that magazine had the insight to test
7:29,the efficiency of man riding a bicycle
7:31,and man riding a bicycle was twice as
7:33,good as the Condor all the way off the
7:34,end of the list and it really
7:36,Illustrated man's ability as a tool
7:38,maker to Fashion a tool to amplify an
7:40,inherent ability that he has and that's
7:42,really exactly what we feel we're doing
7:44,we're really sort of Blazing the trails
7:47,for the 21st century bicycle but to
7:49,amplify a slightly different inherent
7:51,ability that man has the ability of a
7:53,certain part of intelligence right now
7:55,we're at the mechanical part of
7:56,intelligence where one of these devices
7:58,can free a person from many of the
8:01,drudgeries of life and allow really
8:03,humans to do what they do best which is
8:04,to work on the conceptual level to work
8:06,on the creative level all right David
8:08,Burnham you have some concerns about
8:10,computers and I guess in part they have
8:12,to do with the invasion of privacy and
8:14,they do invade our privacy do they not
8:16,they certainly do and we have many
8:18,examples from our history Mr job said
8:21,that the computer Amplified the ability
8:23,of man that's true but man history tells
8:27,us has done good things and he's also
8:29,done bad
8:31,things the the Census Bureau for example
8:33,used computerized Punch Cards to help
8:36,locate the Japanese Americans in 1941
8:39,when they were all so many of them were
8:41,arrested on the west coast all right I I
8:44,keep borrowing this phrase from the NRA
8:46,you know guns don't kill people people
8:48,kill people computers don't do that to
8:50,people people using computers do that
8:52,isn't a computer in and of itself a a a
8:55,neutral tool that can be used for good
8:57,or or evil it is is and men use guns to
9:01,kill people and men use guns to hunt
9:04,animals the question is is our society
9:06,alert enough to understand the power of
9:08,the computer and to turn it toward the
9:10,good things or are there people and
9:13,occasions when we use this tool for a
9:16,bad purpose all right Steve Jobs I I I
9:19,realize this is your baby and you've
9:20,made a you've made a career out of it
9:22,but you're also something of a
9:24,philosopher do you see the the inherent
9:26,possibility of of bad coming out of all
9:28,of this well I think uh one of the
9:30,things you really have to look at is you
9:31,have to go watch some kids using these
9:33,things uh as an example 97% of the high
9:37,school students that graduate from
9:38,Minnesota have hands-on experience with
9:40,these personal computers learning how to
9:42,use them we call this computer literacy
9:44,they're actually happening in you know
9:45,in the elementary schools now and you go
9:48,watch kids interact with these
9:50,computers and what you find is far from
9:52,something quite harmful in effect what
9:55,you what you see is an instantaneous
9:58,reflection of a part of themselves uh
10:01,the creative part of themselves being
10:02,expressed and it's just very very
10:05,difficult to see these kids using this
10:06,tool and realizing that they're going to
10:08,have these tools available for the rest
10:09,of their lives to portray that as
10:11,something very harmful it's uh it's
10:13,actually something quite Democratic all
10:14,right but I mean the government and and
10:16,I think Mr Burnham was leading Us in
10:17,this direction the the the government
10:19,has the capacity by using computers to
10:22,get all kinds of information on us that
10:24,we're really not even aware that they
10:26,have isn't that dangerous well I think
10:28,the best protection against something
10:30,like that is a very literate public and
10:32,in this case computer literate and I
10:34,think you're actually seeing that happen
10:36,right now uh in the personal computer
10:38,area again computers that people can
10:40,afford themselves uh we've already
10:43,reached approximately one in every
10:45,thousand households in the United States
10:47,and I think over the next five or six
10:49,years that figure will be one in 10
10:51,ultimately it will be one in one and uh
10:54,I think the feeling of computer literacy
10:56,among the populace is the thing that for
10:59,me at least gives me the most comfort
11:00,that that centralized intelligence will
11:02,have the least effect on our lives
11:04,without us knowing it Mr Burnham are you
11:06,comforted by that thought that somehow
11:07,we will all have the capacity to defend
11:09,ourselves against computers by owning
11:11,and being able to control computers well
11:14,I wonder whether the individual citizen
11:16,alone is any match say for the United
11:19,States Army when a few years ago it
11:21,began surveillance programs of hundreds
11:23,of thousands of people who were lawfully
11:26,opposed voicing their opposition to the
11:28,war in Vietnam I wonder whether the
11:31,individual citizen can control the army
11:33,or whether the individual citizen can
11:36,control the Census Bureau if it decides
11:38,to break the rules and make information
11:42,available which the citizen has given to
11:44,it all right but on balance are you for
11:47,them or again them I think there's a
11:49,tremendous danger that the public is not
11:52,aware of enough at this moment I think
11:55,if we are aware that perhaps we can use
11:58,them for the good things that Mr jobs
12:00,sees in them all right computer literacy
12:02,you're both in favor of that and I thank
12:04,you both very much for being with us
